HAMIDA! - episode one - Wattpad
My name is Hamida Abdullahi, am 24 and a business woman! Am not talking about businesses that deals with contract or any political demands No! Am talking about business that has to do with life and death
With the human soul and flesh
I made a promise to someone or rather something, so powerful than man, I made a promise to get something for something and now the journey begins
I didn't do this intentionally, I was being forced into it, I've being molested both physically and mentally despite my mother being alive, she has no say on this
My story is a twisted tale, filled with horror and thole, filled with hurts and disappointment
I haven't being lucky, rather my life hasn't being a good one
After years of struggle and endurement, I was finally free with my mom, free and far away from my enemies
And ready to start a new life

HAMIDA! - episode two - Wattpad
I now school in Kaduna polytechnic, studying Food production, such an interesting course to study I live now with my mother in Malali we aren't the same people we were before we now grow with power and respect it took me forever to be where I am today
hamida!  I heard a very strange voice calling from a far it was loud at first, then a whisper fading away into darkness
My body was shaking and trembling with fear, I stood motionly in darkness and fright
hamida! I heard again it came like a rush, the wind taking it farther away I turned around abruptly to every direction I heard the voice it wasn't a normal voice it's a mixed tone of terror and revenge
I was really terrified, I was so scared to run, I couldn't, cause I was blinded by darkness
It was completely dark, no sign of light
The more I try to focus my sight, the more I see nothing
I began to sob faintly, placing my palms on my face,  Mom!
where are you? I whispered to my self,  you've failed us Hamida! the voices came rushing towards me again
I jerked off standing still as tears filled my eyes rolling down my cheeks,  you've failed us! it came again fading away
I clenched on my tattered outfit shutting my eyes tight
The voices came this time, hard and loud  you' ve failed us!  I screamed holding my head bowing down to my knees  what do you want from me!? the voices began to laugh evilly before saying  we want, what belongs to us! 
I stood up wandering around still unsure of what they meant  feed us! Or we shall feed on you!  they added
I turned to get a clear view when I saw an image, of a tall strange figure with a white garmet, it's height was abonormal and it's posture was slightly bent to the side, walking like it was forcing it's self towards me 
I took a step back trying to get farther away from it, but found it hard to do so, I tried to raise my left leg but couldn't, I tried the other leg and was stiff to the ground

HAMIDA! - Episode three - Wattpad
I don't have friends I don't keep friends I only have allies and sometimes when am done with them I toss them away
Friends make me weak can't let that happen again I was once weak and it made me a pond to others
This time I make them my pond and use them how I so ever wish
I was done with lectures it was so boring and exhausted I've being sighting someone from across the school diner when I went to have lunch he was a definition of perfection he looked absolutely breathtaking to me and I wanted him I want him to fill up that empty space that's missing
I won't let him go, have to find a way to get to him
I saw him sitting in group with his friends, discussing having a great time, then noticed a lady sitting by him, placing a hand on his shoulder caressing him by his ear, 
he turned facing her smiling lovely at her,  awww! What a beautiful couple, too bad it will have to end soon I said mentally smiling evilly towards them
I yawned closing my mouth with the back of my hands
When suddenly I sight someone I know, walking to them  bingo! time to make my move, I smirked before gulping down my drink fast wiping away my mouth with the back of my hand
I stood up, and adjusted my beautiful flawless peach gown, looking absolutely stunning in it I don't like applying make up love being natural and it makes me confident
I walked towards them, as my heels made a clink sound to the floor smiling at them with my head high ambling confidently to them
Hamida! How are u baby girl? the guy I was familiar with, Hussein asked, I smiled my perfect smile  how u doing Darling? I asked back  well, we're all good he added, I was still smiling when I made eye contact with mr perfect
he gave me a charming smile, but I didn't respond to that, I turned back facing the clique  what are u guys up to!?  I asked  why don't you get a seat and join us, will let u know what's up! one of the guys replied
I got a chair and sat in between two amazing looking guys, contented smiling dazzling at them  so fill me in! I replied  there'll be a bonfire next week here in campus, we're just trying to figure out how to plan it he added, I was pleased with what he said, perfect day for sacrifice, 
so when is it!? And what time!? I asked,a guy sitting opposite me next to mr perfect replied  on Friday! By 12 am I raised both eye brow, on Friday isn't good, damn it I can't Make the sacrifice on Friday it should be done by Sunday
interesting, but Why can't you all make it Sunday? I mean, it's a bonfire right, it should be during the weekends, most preferable  I stated
They all seemed quiet, reminiscing on what I said,  we've never tried during the weekends  one of the guys replied, I was so caught up in our discussion didn't know a certain someone was carefully staring at me
we should definitely make it on Sunday! It should be fun to try out new things  I said sweetly  why do u keep on insisting the bonfire should be on Sunday? the lady sitting next to mr perfect said, giving me a hard glare
I wasn't the only one staring at her, who is she to challenge me  and what's your deal with my opinion!?  I asked  am just curious, we don't know you, you just barge in from no where, and change everything 
I raised both eye brow staring at the lady who is still willingly trying to challenge me  and who are you? I asked uninterested, she smiled turning facing mr perfect before turning her attention back on me 
my name is Firdausi! Feedo in short, the queen bee and one of the organizers of the bonfire, you can't come in here out of nowhere and change what has already being fixed you can't do that sweety! she repliedI smiled nodding my head  my apologies Queen Bee, how do I become a member of this club of yours I asked, feedo smiled wickedly at me and that kinda made me feel terrified

Thank you dearest auntüòò
U are a talented novelist my dear keep it up
HAMIDA! - episode four - Wattpad
I've being so busy ever since the queen bee decided to make me a member
Didn't know it was so much work and talking
Time was running and am yet to pay my dues, I get chills all over me when ever I remember that am yet to settle those beings
I've had series of nightmares whenever I go to sleep, either see me being chased by a monster with the head of demon and legs of a horse blood dripping from its mouth ready to pounce on me and feed on my flesh or a vision of a strange creature with black cloak pointing towards my direction floating in mid air things have being hard for me and these days I hardly see my mother I go out early when she's still asleep and come back home when she's already fully into her slumber
feedo has being up on my tails, watching my every movement, I just can't bare with her anymore
here I am with the rest of the organizers at printing department, trying to figure out what's needed for the events,  y'all shouldn't forget the drinks and food, know that not all of us can survive a whole day without eating shouted Ibrahim we all burst into laughter  and u think everyone is a foodie like you? Anna replied to him glaring
They were all discussing about what to do and how to plan, when I spotted a lean tall guy with glasses coming towards the building
My eyes began to twitch, my fingers shook abruptly, as beads of sweat rolled down on my forehead 
are you okay Hamee? Anna asked placing a hand on my shoulder, I bent lower clutching on my tommy, everyone's attention turned to me  is she okay? asked one of the guys
I suddenly jolted out from my state and was back to normal, everyone looked petrified on what just happened  am alright! Am okay!  I replied,  but you were in pain just few minutes ago said Hussein with a worried face 
I smiled and sniffed cleaning my sweat with the tissue Anna gave me
I assured them I was okay before excusing myself, walking to my car, I wore in a black with white stripe jumpsuit and a black veil on my head
I was heading there when I bumped into him, he turned to me and apologized before heading into the department
I sighed as I sat comfortably in my seat, with the Ac on, after few minutes I began to hear whispers of strange voices it started in a low tone then to a high pitched tone  He's the one! it began  we want him it whispered  we want his blood and flesh the voice kept on repeating those words over and over again
I shut my eyes as I received the message
A loud knock came from my window as I jerked out of the state I was in
my car is all tinted no one could see a thing standing outside
Hamee! U in there!? Hussein asked as he hit on the window again I wind it down as Hussein was now on view  are u okay dear? he asked staring at me looking concerned, I sighed heavily turning giving him a sad smile  am fine Hussein! Never being better I gave him a weak smile
Hussein looked at me suspiciously  you're not telling me something  he added I was about to say something, when he opened the door for me I walked out leaning my back on it  what's wrong Hamee? Hussein asked again
Gosh was I really starting to get pissed off with his questions  I said am fine Hussein please he was mute, observing me closely  you've being acting weird lately, I figured  I rubbed my Temple trying not to get irritated  kill him If he angers you the voice in my head said
We should go back to the others, we've being out too long I ignored him with the voice in my head we both headed back to the clique as deep within me, knows what I have to do, to keep myself alive and the ones I love
The day was over, I drove straight home, got there early so I figured mom should be in her room awake, went in and found her praying
I smiled and went on laying on her bed starring at the innocent woman I call Mother
Oh we've being through a lot in the past, I could still remember how I lost my womanhood to my God forsaking uncle pfft I hated his guts and I never regretted what I did to him and his friends
I grinned widely with just the thought of it
you seemed to be early today my dear mother said as she took off her himar, I turned smiling at her  I haven't seen you in a while now mom so I figured to come home early and spend little time with u I replied as I sat straight 
what have you being up to Hameeda? mother asked
I rubbed my temple sighing hard  it's complicated mom I can't tell you  mother widen her eyes in shock
so now we keep secrets ehh Hameeda? mother smiled shaking her head  you've being hiding things from me ever since we left Uncle Bala's residents and hearing that terrible news that he passed on, may his soul rest in peace such a peaceful man I immediately scoffed rolling my eyes when mom said the last statement
I've being meaning to ask you Hameeda about how you got such a huge amount of money in such a short time I just didn't wanted to ask at first though am your mother I should have ask right from the very first day we stepped into this house, so tell me I sighed hard
felt bad and so upset about what she said, why would she ask me about this now?  mom what's with the questions?  I asked uninterested with the topic she was heading to  I need to know Hameeda, how are u getting all these money u spend And this huge house as well?  mother immediately gasped putting both hands on her lips  I hope what am thinking isn't what you're doing  mother glared at me with a hand on her hip

Sweating and affraid
HAMIDA! - episode five - Wattpad
I stood up abruptly stretching myself while mother was staring at me waiting for answers  I don't know what you're trying to say mom, but whatever you're thinking isn't what am doing and I'll tell you everything soon I promise, but now isn't the right time  I replied
but hameeda I
I placed my hands on mother's shoulder before pecking her on the cheek  just know that your daughter have being a very good girl and those upbringing u did on me won't go to waste cause I will never let you down, I love you mom more than anything in the world
You're my idol and I Cherish you all I need from you is to pray for me mother smiled dragging me closer to her hugging me so tight  I love you too my dear she whispered
I bid mom a good day before heading to my room
I shut the door behind me leaning shutting my eyes hard letting a lone tear fall on my cheek  am so sorry mom I sniffed  am so sorry  I whispered to myself
I went to the bathroom and washed myself got out and pray before laying on my bed thinking of a possible way to get the business done
I remember, all to well how it began and what lead to the current situation I am now
I never thought I would find anyone that would make me feel love and care about me the way my mother does
She's the only love I had and will always have
But meeting up with these people made me realize it's okay for me to care for someone other than my family and now I regret everything I've done everything
I lost myself to my uncle when I was 19, my father died of diabetes he suffered a great deal losing both legs and an arm I saw how my mother worked endlessly day and night on my Dad and I was in SS2 going to 3 and had to stop schooling cause my mom wasn't able to go to work and cared for dad at the same time, I had to choose, my school or family
I choosed my family cause mother always say family comes first
I hawked and did chores for people just to get enough money for food and hospital bills
I even had to fetch woods and sell outside our house just to make a living
Day after Day I kept doing that, sometimes I hardly eat throughout the day after having breakfast I go out in search for money that I forgot to feed myself not knowing that's what I need to keep me going
Gosh life was so hard and thole to bear
Two months later, dad died
It was the hardest thing for me to believe that the one person I wanted so bad to be okay and see me successful was finally gone
We settled in with my dad's elder brother Uncle Bala and his wife who at first showed us love and care, but after a while when everything was okay they changed
I went to my uncle told him I was ready to go back to school
He said I shouldn't a beautiful girl like me should only think of settling in with a man now and not to think about education
Female education isn't all that useful he said, the only thing a female is most useful at is being loyal to her husband in the kitchen and bed
I felt disgusted at him and left his room immediately
I went to my mom crying on her shoulder and told her what happened, she only smiled and agreed to what uncle Bala said
I felt my world came crushing down on me, all hopes and dreams were gone
Not you too mom I cried
Things kept on happening in that household I was the eldest in the family they have only two children whom are twin a boy and a girl both 5 years of age
I became a slave I worked my ass out day and night I never had time for myself
My Uncle's wife called me lazy despite all the work I've being doing
My mom didn't have a say to all that happen to me and whatever decision is to be made
My mom and uncle's wife decided to go on a wedding celebration one day, to spend two days with the children and am to be left alone with my uncle
They all left that day after doing the chores and dinner, my uncle was out since morning and didn't return till late midnight
He came back and called out my name I went to meet him and brought his dinner
After he was done I washed the dishes and decided to go back to bed
But all that seemed like a bad idea for me
I was half asleep when the door creaked opened unaware of what's to come, I was in only a vest and a wrapper that covered up my body cause the weather was hot
I was enjoying my slumber when my uncle decided to do the unexpected
I heard the door shut with a bang sound and jolted up seeing him in just a long pants he walked towards me, gently telling me to calm down everything would be alright I shook my head abruptly in fear for what's to come trying not to let him come closer
I was about running out of the room when he grabbed me by the waist and threw me unto to the ground straddling on me trying to take off his pants
I screamed he slapped me on the face telling me to keep my mouth shut or he would dealt with me
I begged him not to do so, I pleaded
He ignored, I tried to fight him off me, but was too strong on me
I was just a 19 year old girl trying to fight off a 54 year old man
I screamed harder and cried but no one came to my aid, I told him to stop but he only gwaffed and kept on with his business After he was done, he got up sweating like a Christmas goat, smirking evilly at me telling that when next he decides to come back for another round and I try to fight him off, he would make sure he deals with me mercilessly
He cursed before leaving me in a state of confusion, hurt, disappointment, regret and very very pissed off
I never told my mother what happened that night, I couldn't
I never hid anything from her and this situation was a very hard one for me to keep
What do I do, how do I tell my mother Uncle Bala gave me a mark
A stainful mark that will never go away
Hhhhhhh mother always say a woman's pride is to not have that stainful mark
It's a mark that doesn't fade away
I had to keep it to myself I had no other choice
And yet that old twart never let me be, he follows me around like a dog hungry for more
Hungry for satisfaction, he didn't stop there he invited more of his friends to have a piece of what he'd enjoy when no one was around
He promised me if I had to do this and earn lots of money, he would send me back to school
Another deadly secret I had to keep
Whenever his friends needed me, he would call me instantly when my mother and his wife was around telling me to get something for him in a market far away from where we lived and then he winks
I became a Mistress to them, they used me however they wish
Whenever I try to lay a complaint, my Uncle dared me to say a word, he promised if I told anyone, he would turn the whole story on me, telling them I was the one following them begging them to lay with me
Oh the terror of being in that house made me hate Men entirely, I hate seeing them, I detest them with my life
Two years I was enslaved by them, I couldn't run I had nowhere to go
I couldn't tell I'll be framed for doing nothing
I was being tortured against my will
I worshipped them like they owned me I did everything I had to do being a niece to my uncle and a daughter to his wife
I told mother I was tired of living there, I told her I want us to leave and find another home
I told her to find a home where I can be there slave and work for them endlessly
She doesn't understand what am going through, she doesn't understand the pain I have to live with, every single day of my life
Hola peeps sup! A new episode for u hope ur digging into it like I am

HAMIDA! - episode six - Wattpad
The wind blew through my curtains swaying it around, as it whistles making a ghostly sound, I didn't hear cause I was deep in my thoughts
the door that leads outside my balcony suddenly creaked opened like someone was there making that disturbing sound
the door swung opened wide as massive wind blew in bringing leaves and sheets scattered all over my floor
I hissed rolling out of bed  I didn't leave this door open I said placing a hand on my hip with a raised brow  stupid wind left a mess in my room I said walking towards the door shutting it
I turned and jumped out in fear  Oh my dear lord! I shouted
My heart was racing fast in my chest placing a hand on it  you gave me such a fright old woman I said sitting down on my bed
The old woman looked calm as an owl, she held a long stick with both arms starring closely at me, she was really old
wrinkles all over her face and hands looks rather soft mere seeing, you could easily prickle it with a needle
I smiled  so! How's life? I asked grinning widely at her
She held a straight face saying nothing, not moving at all
She was mute but was watching me closely with her wide black terrifying eyes  you didn't keep to your words this time child she finally said
I became weak aware of what she meant I sighed heavily brushing a hand in my hair  I know, I was busy lately and things were kinda complicated for me right now  I replied  you were told whom to sacrifice weren't you? said the old woman I looked at her standing up facing to her direction
maybe I don't want to do this anymore  I confessed  I've worshipped you guys for long, I've done everything possible as your command
the old woman hissed smiling as she cocked her head sideways staring deep into my eyes
I felt so cold all of a sudden, I began to shiver as I find it hard to breath
It was like someone held on to my throat chocking me blurring my vision
I needed air as my eyes began to turn to the back of my head
Falling down on my knees, I saw my life flash through my eyes
Was I dying
Are they finally going to kill me for not obeying their commands
My lungs tightened hard, there was no air left in me  P-pl-please i-i'll do it j-just st-stop the words came out rough and hard in my throat
I gasped hard and fast, as I began to cough continuously
It hurts so bad that my body trembled in anxiety
I fell on the ground trying to hold on to my breath  this is just a warning Hameeda! Do what we ordain or you shall pay the price  she echoed
I turned trying to get a view of the old woman, pfft she was gone
Disappeared into thin air
I felt bad, I hated myself
I knew if I don't do what they ask, they will not hesitate to hurt me
I have to do it, I have to make the sacrifice
I don't have a choice
I isolated myself, not in the mood for anything
I looked worn out and exhausted
Didn't want anyone asking questions
I've being in the department for far too long I was sitting in the back Conner of the class looking bored and angry
My phone ranged severally, it was Hussein Calling
I ignored it as I kept thinking of a possible way out this
I can't, I can ever leave this life that I've chosen for myself
The only possible way out of this is either I make the sacrifice or give them my soul, which am not read to do that just yet
I groaned hard out of frustration as I got on my feet wandering around the class
Hussein kept calling over and over, am not ready to answer his questions just yet
And am sure he's got dozens of them, my phone beeped and blinked turning on my screen and viewing his message 
I hope you have a good explanation for rejecting my calls, where are you Hameeda everyone is worried sick about where you've being all day
Am worried too, please call me if you received this message or better still come so we can talk about what's bothering you it read
I groaned harder as I threw my phone on the walls scattered on the floor
I can't do this
Am not going to let anything stand in my way am not ready to die yet am too young for that now
I have to make the sacrifice today
I have to do it no matter what
I glanced at my wrist watch and it was noon
I hurriedly got my bag and walked out of the lecture room straight to my car
Turned on the engine before stepping on the pedal driving away as fast as I can
I went back home hurriedly walking to my room shutting it with a key
Went to my closet, and got out my night outfit
I wore on my tight black jean with a black hoodie, black snickers and gloves
I looked ready for work, ready for sacrifice and get my reward
I went to the closet that was close to my mirror, it had everything I needed for the sacrifice
My Axe, medium size cutlass, a butcher knife and a big black wrapping bag for the body
I got a powdery substance from a small red cloth, and blew it on my mirror, chanting some words
Then it began, the mirror magically was turning black and red  show me the one whose blood was choosing and will live his entire life as bait to the other world I exclaimed staring at the mirror patiently waiting
Suddenly, the image was on view I gasped holding my mouth with wide terrifying eyes
No! No! No! No
I began to tremble, sweat all over me, it can't be, I shook my head as tears rolled down my cheek
why! why! Do you have to ruin my life I screamed walking back as I sat on my bed, terrified of what I saw, I cried endlessly and screamed
Mother might have heard me cried
She banged on my door severally  Hameeda open the door, what's wrong darling  she said  am so sorry mother, I've failed you I said  am a bad person  I cried  no you're not baby , please open the door and talk to me I shook my head crying out my heart
I laid on the floor whimpering and shivering trying to control myself
What have I done? I kept on asking myself, where have I gone wrong
An hour later, I decided to walk out of the house and drive far away from home
I sneaked out not wanting to let mom know I was leaving the house
I immediately got to my car and drove out not minding to close the gates
Hey guys sup! Who do you think Hamida saw in the mirror? Would she really leave town and forget about her poor old mother? Like, vote and comment
Happy Reading

Beautiful, keep it up our future leader
Thank you aunt m glad ur enjoying the book
My heart keeps beating as I continue reading yr fantastic novel
Don t want to put the novel down even for a second
HAMIDA! - episode seven - Wattpad
I drove fast and recklessly not minding the curse and horn I received
My heart was filled with hurt and regret
It ached beating fast, didn't know what to do, I can't run away either  oh God help me I sniffed as I tried to get a tissue from a box that was on the passengers seat, I didn't see where I was going
I lost control of the wheels and slammed into a nearby tree
I crashed hard, went unconscious and numb
I became conscious when I heard faint noises
Where was I? I said mentally to myself
I tried to open up my eyes but find it hard to do so, I tried to move but felt a sharp pain in my right arm
Where was I? I asked mentally
would she be okay?  I heard a familiar voice asking  she'll be alright, she had just minor injuries but she'll live  a woman replied to him and walked away as I heard her footsteps fade away
I moved my hands and tried to open up my eyes, when I sighted a blur image standing before sitting by my side
My eyes were now on view as I turned and saw the person sitting by me
I blinked twice before resting my head to the side facing him
He smiled sweetly before leaning closer stroking my cheek
Staring at me with contentment and lust
I felt weak and tired my body ached with every move I tried to make
you're gonna hurt yourself if you try moving, you need to rest he said with a promising tone
He just sat there with his hands on my forehead caressing, loving every moment, staring at me in away his never done before
I like this, I want it to last forever I don't know why I've never gave him my time I felt bad
He was a man, a man who cared about me and what have I given in return? Nothing
Hussein was perfect
He has always being the one who cared most
The one who made my business his even though I've never trusted him before to tell him my situation
I feel so ashamed and devastated about it
I closed my eyes shut as I swallowed hard trying to get a grip of myself
are you okay? he asked I turned staring into those gorgeous eyes of his I nod
you sure you're okay Hamee? he asked again I smiled showing him I was okay
He didn't ask any questions about how I got myself into this mess
No all he did was care for me until I was up and ready
He spent days and night at the hospital with me until I was discharged
I was okay but there were bruises on my cheek bone and my left eye is still swollen
I have sprain my left leg so the doctor said I would have to stay indoors for some days before walking again
Hussein walked me to his car, opening the passengers door for me before jogging to his side
He hopped in shutting the door and starting the engine
He turned smiling at me  so where to? Ur mother's ? he asked  No!
I replied abruptly
He stared with wide eyes raising both brow  why not?  he asked I sighed resting my head no my hand
Hamida why don't you want me to take u home? he asked I shut my eyes tightly rubbing my temple
could you please take me away from here, not my house I replied staring through the window
He said okay before igniting and driving away
It was an hour drive
We got to a house which could be a family house of his cause it was huge
It was a big mansion surprisingly, no one was home
I got into the living room and I was in awe
It was simply exquisite
I sat on the large brown leather sofa that was place in the middle of living room resting gracefully on it pleased and at ease
Hussein walked into one of the rooms before coming out to see him changed in a black sweatpants with a white tank top with the word cool written on it
I smiled at him looking how boyish and attractive he looked
His hair was damped, he sat on the other two by two sofa grinning at me
no one's home? I asked  no ones ever home  he replied I nod my head staring at the center rug that was placed in the middle of the living room
It looked very creepy and frightening, it was dark with a big white skull with red stain on the side
What kind of a werido would have something so creepy in the middle of his living room I thought  are they on holiday or something?  I asked not looking his way  this is my house Hamida he said, I immediately turned facing his direction
He kept a cool calm face still smiling
I widen my eyes still nodding my head  you should rest for now he added  I'll take you to ur room he said as he stood up and motion me to follow him
I did same walking behind him as we walked up to the upper part of the house and showed me to my room
I walked in with satisfaction on my face, I love the room
It was simple but complex in a different way
I smiled turning to thank Hussein but his expression said otherwise he didn't smile or regard me as he used to
He kept a straight face staring at me with both hands in his pants
I swallowed hard knowing he was going to start with the questions
I felt my heart beating rapidly in my chest, my hands began to sweat rubbing it to my side to take the damp off
He kept staring not saying a word
I felt uncomfortable with that, my eyes wandered around the room trying not to make eye contact with him
It was a failure, every time I try not to look his way I find my eyes searching for his
His beautiful dark eyes bore into mine making my heart melt in an instance
This time I didn't look away
I stared into his
Every moment that I've being seemed to passed by so fast but this, this was taking me to a different world entirely
I won't mind standing here forever having such feelings in me
He was amazing but right now, at this moment he wasn't smiling or regarding me
He glared at me now folding his arms
are u okay? I asked concerned taking all of his cuteness
I'll have to admit he looks cute when upset  you know am not Hamee I need answers
he said standing straight still looking puffed out
I know what he meant I'll just have to pretend I know nothing of what he was talking about
please elaborate on what u meant I said raising my hand in mid air
He sighed frustrated stroking his hair  I don't know what you want me to say, I don't know what you want me to do am just so so confused, and I need answers  I raised a brow rolling my eyes as I sat on the king sized bed sighing hard
If I don't tell him what he needs to know, he'll keep on bugging me asking questions
But I can't tell him, I can't share my deep secrets with him
I don't know if I can trust him, and am starting to have feelings for him which is kinda awkward right now
am sorry Hussein I can't tell you anything  I said lowering my gaze on him
I don't want him to see me weak and vulnerable, I am strong I won't let my weaknesses show
He should know that am a strong woman and can deal with whatever situation I find myself in well hopefully

HAMIDA! - episode eight - Page 3 - Wattpad
I found myself sitting by the bed side, frustrated and confused
I sighed hard lowering my head trying to hide my face
He sat next to me holding my hands  I know how you feel, you can trust Hamida I shook my head trying to take my hands away from his
He held on tight to me  am not letting you go, you won't shut me out
I want you to tell me what's going on I want to help tears were beaming from my eyes
I trembled  am sorry Am so sorry I can't  I cried as a lone tear found it's way down my cheek Hussein got my chin and held my head up making eye contact with me
He wiped my tear with his thumb stroking the back of my head with his fingers
It felt so good I don't want him to stop
I shut my eyes close taking in the pleasure his fingers were making at the back of my head
I felt so alive and at ease with my self  am right here Hamida, am not letting you go
You can trust me tell me whatever no matter how bad it is, I will never judge you 
I opened my eyes tears blurred my vision, I blinked twice before getting a clear view of him
Gosh was he amazing his holding me so close to him only mere inches away from our face touching his eyes bore into mine holding so many emotions
I could tell he really cares for him and I also care for him as well
I'll do whatever it takes to be with him, whatever
Cause I want this, I want this so bad I want him to hold me close, tell me he would never let me go and that I'll be his forever
tell me everything  he whispered and I nod
He kissed me on my forehead for some seconds before letting me rest for a while
I know this would be hard, hard for me to tell him my story
Tell him how bad of a person I was and recently am, and how many innocent men's blood are in my hands
I hope he won't find me evil and would still want to be with me, I just hope he won't hate me
Hussein left me in my room so I could rest
I laid on the king sized bed facing the ceiling as I ponder about the incident that happened earlier and how I got myself into that terrible accident
why would they do this? Why would they want me to take down someone's life that's so dear to me, I can't do this am so tired  I said to myself weakly as a lone tear made it's way down to my cheek
I bit my lower lip hard shutting my eyes hard as I felt the taste of my blood in my mouth
I have no choice but to tell Hussein what he needed to know
But first I need to know if I could trust him
If I could share my deepest darkest secret with him, hope he doesn't find me an awful person
I turned to my side resting my head on my palm as I shut my eyes ready to drift into slumber
I slept like a baby
I can't remember when last I slept this much
I opened my lids as I was welcomed with darkness
I slipped out of my sheets dragging myself into the darkness trying not to crash with anything
finally made my way to the door turning the knob and it creaked opened
The hall way was dark, and the house was extremely quiet
You could hear the sound of breeze swaying around
I made myself down to the living room quickly found the light switch to make it visible to see
I sat on one of the sofas sighing hard resting my head an my hands
I was sitting when I heard a loud crashing sound coming from the kitchen
I immediately made my way only to be greeted by shattered and broken glass on the floor
I gasped closing my mouth in shock  how did all this made their way to the floor? They're ruined I said
I went closer trying to clear the whole place up
Picking up the shattered glass with my hand when it mistakenly cut my index
I hissed dragging my hands backward in pain as blood oozed out of my finger
Then I began to hear strange voices buzzing around the house
Hamida!  it whispered very low and faint but with terror and anger
I stood up abruptly in fright, widening my eyes I went out towards the living room scouting the area
No one was here  Hamida!  it came again moving around the house making me jerk in fright
who's there?  I said with a trembling voice
The voice came rushing towards me as I quivered and shout trying to run back to my room
When I suddenly hit my head on the wall falling back on the floor with a thud sound
I yelped as my body cried in pain
Turning my back flat when i looked up at the ceiling only to see an image of something crawling above
My blood boiled in fear as the hairs on my skin bristle
My heart began to beat rapidly
what is that? I said mentally
I stood up slowly trying not to feel the pain my body gave
I reached for the stairs but something gripped onto my hair as I cried more in pain
It fingers dug into my scalp as I yelled loudly Dragging me hard flinging me onto the other side crashing on the hard wall
my body became limp unable to move
I hissed as I tried to make effort to get my numb body going again, but each time I try to move I feel more pains on my right shoulder
I finally was up when I came face to face with something tremendous terrifying
I flinched in fright as the demon right upfront was staring straight at me with those terrifying big red eyes of his
I whimpered and trembled as tears were already streaming down wetting my face down to my lose silk gown
w-what d-do y-you want from me? I cried, the demon only growled as it walk towards me slowly
Showing its big stained fangs with sharp claws stained of blood and flesh from its victims
I walked back slowly trying not to make any sudden movements for it to cut me with one swing of it's claws
I walked back as it came closer with every step I take
Not losing eye contact I whimpered shutting my eyes ready for this devilish demon to slay me down
Quiet, nothing happened, I peeked with one eye only to see an empty living room
No demon just me
I sighed hard as my body kept quivering in terror
that was close I murmured leaning my back against the wall sliding down on the floor as tears kept rolling down my cheeks
I placed my foot together hugging myself rolling back and forth  everything's gonna be alright  I said with a shaky voice
it's gone, thank God it's gone I whimpered low
I motioned myself to get up, but found it hard
I used the wall to help me get up
My body was in so much pain that I ignored it and walked back to the kitchen limping using the wall as a support until I got to there
I shut my eyes hard and inhaled deep, I opened them up walking gently not to fall on the broken pieces
I got the broom to clean the place up when I lost my balance and fell on it
I cried and hissed on the new set of pain that emerged
I couldn't move I was sitting there motionly on the broken glass blood oozed out around the floor with both hands and knees on it
New sets of tears made their way down
I shut my mouth tightly not to shout or cry I whimpered hard trying to get control of myself
what the hell is going on here? I heard Hussein yelled
I was too weak to raise my head and get a view of him
He rushed towards me bend over couldn't say a word nor move
are you okay Hamida?  my head began to pound heavily as I couldn't move to let him know I wasn't okay
He held me close trying to get me off from the shattered glasses, he was too careful not to hurt himself as well
I was finally off ground as he took me bridal style walking me towards the living room
Laying me down on the couch  will be right back he said before getting back into the kitchen
I could hear him trying to tidy the place up
I blinked twice trying to get the tear out of my eye, when I started to heard same voice again whispering  it has began! It's over it echoed
I flinched looking around aware of what it meant and said
Then It came back rushing in my head I gasped as I rolled over trying to get myself off of the couch  Hey! Hey! Where do you think you're going? 
Hussein ran to me trying to lay me back
I tried to talk but the words aren't forming  m-ma
m-my
i-I've Hussein nod like he's got an idea of what I was saying  okay! You need to rest, your hurt
You're bleeding Hamida  
I shook my head abruptly still trying to get the words out  N-nnno, p-pplea I tried to shove him aside but he was too strong
stop being stubborn and let me tend to your wounds  he said furrowing his brows
I shook my head, crying letting him know I was in pain my throat was dry and it hurts I tried to let him know
But I remembered telling him what I saw and what happened would only raise alarm on him knowing that I have promised to inform him of my troubles
I looked into his eyes as as he looked into mine
He was really concerned about me he cared and I felt I could trust him
He wiped my still falling tears with his thumb
you haven't told me what's bothering you
And I can tell you're in pain, I told you you could trust me
You're all that I have left he whispered the last word lowering his head
You're All that I have left? His words echoed in my head I turned to see he was sad and lonely
But what does he mean by that? I leaned closer placing my blood stain hands on his
Hussein! he raised his head smiling sweetly at me  don't bother he added I was about to object when he got hold of my hands to clean it up
We both didn't say a word until he was done
I said thank you staring at the bandage both wrapped around my palms  looks like you won't be using them both for a while he smirked
I sighed still staring at him  you haven't answered my question  I replied with a low tone staring at the center rug
and you haven't told me yours either?  he added raising a brow at me
I sighed shaking my head  am sorry, I can't tell you  I started to feel the need to cry again
My eyes began to sting as fresh tears began to form again
I just hope he would forgive me and let this go
I need to know Hamida, please  he pleaded with me to tell him what's going on
I objected for awhile He said he wasn't going to let me be until he hears what he needed to
I had no choice I had to finally do it
I was letting a third party come in between
but you have to promise me, if I tell you
You wouldn't changed your mind towards me and that you would never let me go
Hussein I really need you close to me and in my life forever I cannot afford to lose you now that I've gotten you he smiled 
nothing in the world would make me change my mind towards you the words he said gave me confidence and I started to tell him everything, everything he needed to know about me right from the very start
After telling him my story
How my father died, how my uncle forcefully got his way to me
And how I'd sacrificed them to the unseen and unspoken being
He remained quiet he was emotionless he staired at me like I was telling him a sick joke
He didn't believe me
It showed perfectly on his face  I met the old lady on my way to an errand my uncle's wife sent me on
I was contemplating if to accept or not  
I said in a low tone Hussein shook his head  how do u expect me to believe you? he stated  how do u expect me to believe you're a bad person when in short you look nothing like one he added
Don't try to change the subject, this isn't funny Hameeda  he revealed
am not joking this is real, this is my story no one knows about this not even my own mother  I cried
Hussein expressions showed that he didn't believe me
But as I revealed to him my mother knows nothing about it
He stood up and walked away from me
Saying nothing
Leaving me with only my bitter words and the new sets of pain that emerged from within

HAMIDA! - episode nine - Wattpad
I walked back to my room
My body shaking as new set of tears made their way down to my cheeks
Who would ever believe such a story it was meaningless and sounds untrue
Who would in their right sense agree with such mean full beings, well here I am part of them for quiet a long time now
I don't know what's in Hussein's mind but I just hope he doesn't hate me for what I've done
Oh please God help me am so confused  I have to talk to him  I said to myself  it's the only way to find out what's in his head
I walked to his room that was in the lower part of the house I knocked twice there was no response so decided to walk in
I turned the door knob and was greeted with darkness
It was empty no one was in  Hussein! Hey are you in here? I scout through his room into the bathroom no sign of Hussein
I walked out surprised furrowed my brow thinking were could he have gone to
I decided to walk back to my room and get my phone when the landline rang
I became alarm quiet following the sound, when I spotted it on the wall in the kitchen
It rang over and over non stop
I walked carefully towards it trying to answer when it stopped
I sighed in relief turning my heels to get to my room when the hotline rang again
I frigid and turned majestically to it, walking calming myself down before taking it placing it on my ears
hello!?
I said in a shaky tone
I heard buzzy sound at first before making a hushing sound
I hanged up hugging myself biting my lower lip
I was about making a first step towards the door when it rang again
I got frightened my heart began to pace rapidly
This isn't normal I said to myself
I took the hotline and placed it on my left ears  she's gone  I heard a strange and peculiar voice said laughing mocking evilly
hello, what do you mean she's gone? Who are you? 
I instantly drop the hotline in the floor with wide terrifying eyes  oh no! Mom! I whispered
I hurriedly went to my room to get dressed
But there was no car keys
I went back to Hussein's room and found the car keys on the self
He's not gone? I took the keys and ran out of the house heading to his car
I opened the gates and went back into the car igniting before stepping on the gas driving out insanely
Tears began to form as they roll down my cheeks, wiping with the back of my hands  am coming mommy  I sniffed  Am coming  I whispered with a heavy heart
Finally I got home not minding where I stopped the car
Walking into the house confused and wild
My eyes were red and tender
I sniffed  mom!  I yelled out
mom! Were are you? new set of tears began to form  please mom! I walked to her room it was empty the bed was well laid
I searched for the bathroom
I searched the entire house there was no sign of mom
I felt lost, alone and terrified
I walked out gripping my head blubbering  oh God Mom I wailed  why do you have to take her  I wiped my nose with the back of my hand  why! She is innocent
Take me instead, replace me with her
It's me you want please let her live  I bawled
I went on my knees sobbing silently with my hands up on my face
I was exhausted and frail
I had no idea on what to do
I was rooted with my knees on the floor for an hour and a half
I have to do something, I have to get my mother back
I can't lose her yet
I said mentally shaking my head
I walked back to my room and found my charms well placed the way I left them earlier
I stood in front of the mirror and called upon the oracle
few seconds pass an image of a beautiful lady was on view  you call for us Hameeda, what do you want?
she asked with such a sweet but bitter tone  I-I want my mother back I sighed shutting both eyes
she chuckled  you can't cause you have failed to do your duty 
I shook my head  you cant do this to me, I have being good, faithful and loyal to you, I have served you unconditionally, you cannot have my mother 
I exclaimed
The oracle chuckled evilly  you're mother has already being sacrificed " I whimpered as I stood motionly trying not to break down 
P-ple- please, you can undo this, I don't want her dead I promise this time I'll do anything you wish of me, but please just bring back my mother  I sobbed
fine we would let your mother live only if you'd agree with our terms  I felt a relief and happy 
Yes Yes, I I'll do anything , anything The oracle gave an evil chuckle before finally saying  your mother would live, she'll be fine and healthy only when you agree with our terms and condition  she stated
I nod repeatedly folding both arms
you would find someone to replace your mother, when you've done that bring the sacrifice to the woods where the river and the lake meet and there you would make the sacrifice and know the other conditions that has being laid on you, failure to do so, your mother dies and all the assets you once know would be gone
And don't forget you have 5 hours to do so  the oracle finally said before vanishing
I was mute, I didn't know what to do
I walked back silently sitting on my bed long thought of how to get myself out
I don't want my mother to die and again I don't want to lose what I've gotten
How do I get out of this danger without losing my mother or my asset
Hussein, should I tell him about this?
Does he deserve to know? He cares so much about me and I care about him too
But if he finds out am what am about to do
He would hate me and leave, and I've just gotten him
I hissed laying flat on my back facing the ceiling
I'll have to lie to him
Tell him I've settle scores with them and they've agree to let me be
Live my life the way I want without losing my wealth
And finally have a perfect family with him
It's a risk am willing to take
I'll have both my mother and my love beside me
But it means I'll have to abide by their rules and conditions again
Oh God what should I do?
