# AI4D-Dataset-Challenge
AI4D has put out an African Languages Dataset Challenge &amp; I will be taking the opportunity to brush up on web scraping using the selenium and Beautiful Soup libraries. 

For this Challenge, I have decided to collect text written in Hausa from the following sources:

1. [Dandalinvoa](https://www.dandalinvoa.com/)
2. [Wattpad](https://www.wattpad.com/)
3. [VOA Hausa](voahausa.com)
4. [Hausaloaded](https://www.hausaloaded.com/)
5. [Legit.ng Hausa](http://hausa.legit.ng/)

The notebook I used for each is named as follows:
1. Akawogbekun - which means Observer in Yoruba
2. mahjul - Unfortunately, I can no longer find the translation for this word. 
3. Rapala - borrowed from the Akande Abass Obesere moniker: Omo Rapala
4. Awokose - which means Paradigm in Yoruba
5. Adahunse - which means Independent Consultant in Yoruba
